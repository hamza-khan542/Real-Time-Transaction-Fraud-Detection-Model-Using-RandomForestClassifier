# Transaction Analysis Project

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of transaction data, including data processing, visualization, and machine learning models.

## Dataset

The project uses a cleaned transaction dataset (`dataset/cleaned_transactions.csv`) that contains detailed transaction information. The dataset is managed using Git LFS due to its size.

### Dataset Structure
- File: `cleaned_transactions.csv`
- Size: ~195MB
- Format: CSV

## Project Structure
